# ESP32_Raspberry_PI02W_UDP

This project is based on IoT technology, where we use a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and an ESP32. Using an ultrasonic sensor, 
we measure distances, and through the UDP protocol, both devices connected to the same LAN enable data transmission. 
The ESP32 sends the measurements to the Raspberry Pi, which receives and displays them in real time thanks to this connection.

### Requirements

* Raspberry Pi Zero 2w
* Esp32 (Generic)
* Ultrasonic Sensor 

### Connections between ESP32 and ultrasonic with Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
